// The code we'll add
import store from "./redux/config/configStore";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: <https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals>
reportWebVitals();
